# raycastenstein-3d
Software renderer that functions in a similar way as the renderer used in Wolfenstein 3D from 1992.

## How to play
- Move the camera using `A` and `D`
- Move forward and backward using `W` and `S`

## Compilation
To compile the project, simply use the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.
In this way, you can compile the project using these commands:Ã¹

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
./raycast-engine
```

## How it works
The rendering side of this program is rather simple.
You simply draw the world column by column (where each column is a vertical line on the framebuffer).
Each column of the framebuffer corresponds to a ray that goes from the camera to the object. When an object has been hit (i.e. a wall), the corresponding column is rendered using the color of the object.

The size of the column depends on the distance between the player and the object, rather than the distance traveled by the ray from the center of the camera, otherwise we would get the so called "fisheye effect".

To detect when a wall has been hit, we make use of an algorithm called __DDA__ (Digital Differential Analyzer). This allows the ray to travel very fast on the map, without needing to use a fixed step size that would either miss walls or take too many steps to hit a wall (thus resulting in a performance hit).
